// ===========================================================================
// The LOCAL Executor app, as ONE `ExecutorApp.make` call.
//
// The whole scenario in 60 seconds: single-user identity (always the one local
// Principal) over a SINGLE boot-built executor scoped to the working directory
// (`<basename>-<hash>`, with `oauthEndpointUrlPolicy: { allowHttp: true }`),
// QuickJS in-process code execution, console error capture, Swagger at /docs —
// and NO account API, NO usage metering. `diff` against
// `apps/host-selfhost/src/app.ts` is the whole product difference: local serves
// its ONE cwd executor directly (the `fixedExecution` seam) instead of building
// a per-request `[user-org:…, org]` scoped executor from identity.
//
// `ExecutorApp.make` owns the assembly (the fixed-execution middleware wrapping
// the protected API, the extension routes, provideMerge(boot)). This file's job
// is the eager async boot — building the ONE executor + engine — and slotting
// local's seam Layers into the named slots.
//
// What legitimately stays LOCAL-PLATFORM (the thin `serve.ts` Bun shell, NOT
// make()'s job): the socket binding + idleTimeout, static SPA serving (embedded
// /disk/dev-vite), the one-time legacy SQLite import (run inside the boot bundle,
// BEFORE the executor reaches this seam), the single-credential network gate, the
// /mcp + /api/mcp-sessions resume + /api/oauth/await routes (an in-process,
// single-engine MCP handler with a browser-approval store — local's own surface,
// not the shared multi-user McpServingRoutes envelope), and the `/api`-prefix
// stripping. So `mcp` and `account` are OMITTED, and `mountPrefix` is left at
// root (the Bun shell strips `/api` before the handler).
// ===========================================================================
