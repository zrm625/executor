// The route tree is composed, not hand-mirrored: the shared console routes
// come from @executor-js/react (the package whose shell/pages link to them);
// this app only owns its root (the Cloudflare-Access shell). To add
// app-specific routes, create web/routes/app and mount it inside the org
// scope via `orgScoped: [physical("", "app")]` — the directory must exist.
//
// /users is excluded: this host mounts no admin-users routes (identity is
// Cloudflare Access, which has no in-app role to gate on), so the page would
// only ever render its denied state.
