// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Regression for https://github.com/RhysSullivan/executor/pull/468 — the
// cloud API v4 routing refactor wired DbService.Live (and other I/O-holding
// services) into `Layer.provideMerge` of an `HttpRouter.toWebHandler` app.
// `toWebHandler` builds the layer ONCE at worker boot and reuses the
// resolved Context for every request, so `Effect.acquireRelease` runs only
// at boot. On Cloudflare Workers that means the postgres.js socket (a
// `Writable` I/O object) is opened in request 1's context and reused by
// request 2, which the runtime forbids:
//
//   StorageError: FumaDB findMany select failed:
//     Cannot perform I/O on behalf of a different request. (I/O type: Writable)
//
// The only primitive that actually rebuilds per request is a custom
// `HttpRouter.middleware` whose per-request handler does
// `Layer.build(layer)` inside `Effect.scoped`. `provideMerge` runs the
// layer at boot; `HttpRouter.provideRequest` (despite its name) also runs
// the layer at boot — its `Layer.build` lives in the *outer* middleware
// effect, which executes at layer-construction time. Only an explicit
// `Effect.scoped` inside the per-request handler creates a fresh scope
// for `acquireRelease`.
