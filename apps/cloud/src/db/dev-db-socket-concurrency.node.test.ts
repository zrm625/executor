// Regression for the dev-db PGlite socket protocol-interleaving bug (patched
// in patches/@electric-sql%2Fpglite-socket@0.1.4.patch).
//
// PGLiteSocketServer's QueryQueueManager used to enqueue each postgres wire
// FRAME (Parse, Bind, Execute, Sync) as its own queue entry against the one
// shared PGlite session. With more than one connection (the dev-db now allows
// many — see scripts/dev-db.ts maxConnections), two clients' extended-protocol
// pipelines interleaved: client A's Parse (5 params) ... client B's Parse
// (1 param) ... A's Bind now hits B's unnamed statement:
//
//   PostgresError: bind message supplies 5 parameters, but prepared
//   statement "" requires 1
//
// which surfaced in e2e as random 500s ("Failed to load tools", StorageError)
// on whichever request lost the race — the residual per-spec CI flakes after
// the connection-storm fix. The patch batches all frames of one socket data
// event into a single queue entry and adds handler affinity while a pipeline
// is open, so one client's Parse..Sync executes atomically.
//
// This test drives concurrent clients issuing unprepared parameterized queries
// with DIFFERENT parameter counts (the exact drizzle/postgres-js shape) through
// one PGLiteSocketServer and asserts zero protocol corruption.
