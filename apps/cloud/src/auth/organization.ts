// (via `mcp/auth.ts`), which must not transitively import any billing config

// which DO depend on the Autumn plan config — live in `extensions/billing/plans.ts`.

// Resolution — local mirror with lazy WorkOS fallback.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// We keep a minimal local mirror of organizations so domain tables can
// foreign-key against them and so we don't hit WorkOS on every request.
// But the mirror can drift: a user's session can reference an org that was
// created outside this app (or before the mirror existed). Rather than
// proactively mirroring on every login — which was the source of the messy
// callback flow we just untangled — we mirror lazily the first time an
// unknown org is read. All other callers just do `getOrganization` and get
// a self-healing lookup for free.
//
// URL slugs are OURS (WorkOS orgs have none) and are minted at the moment a
// row is inserted — `upsertOrganization` is the single mint point, so the
// mirror-on-first-read below produces a slugged, routable org without any
// read-path healing.

  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const users = yield* UserStoreService;

  });

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Authorization — live membership check against WorkOS.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// The sealed session cookie carries an organizationId that WorkOS signed at
// login / refresh time. WorkOS does NOT invalidate existing sessions when a
// membership is revoked, and `session.authenticate()` validates the JWT
// locally without hitting the API — so a removed user keeps full access
// until their access token naturally expires (~10 min).
//
// To close that gap we verify membership live on every protected request.
// `listUserMemberships` is one WorkOS call per request.
//
// Caching decision (2026-07): we deliberately do NOT add a positive TTL cache
// here. A positive cache is exactly what would re-open the revocation gap this
// live check exists to close — a revoked member would keep access for the cache
// TTL. Negative caching is worse still (a transient WorkOS blip would get
// pinned as "no access"), so it is out too. The rate-limit amplification a
// shared-API-key org can cause under a WorkOS slowdown is mitigated instead by
// the classification fix at the MCP call site (a blip now yields a retryable
// 503, so it no longer condemns sessions or triggers reconnect storms). If per-
// request WorkOS load later proves to be the bottleneck, the right structural
// fix is a local memberships table fed by the WorkOS Events API (authoritative,
// no staleness window), not a TTL cache over this call — tracked as follow-up.
//
// Returns the resolved organization (via resolveOrganization) if the user
// currently holds an *active* membership in it, otherwise null. Callers
// should treat null as "no access" and route accordingly (onboarding page /
// 403).

// Org-scoped requests carry the active org in this header, set by the web
// client from the console URL's slug (the MCP plane carries the same idea in
// its own `x-executor-mcp-organization`). The selector is a slug (`acme`, the
// readable URL form) or a WorkOS id (`org_…`, the legacy/token form). It is a
// SELECTOR, not a trust boundary: `authorizeOrganizationSelector` re-checks
// live membership, so the worst a forged header does is name an org the caller
// already belongs to.
//
// Why a header and not the session's `org_id`: a browser shares ONE cookie jar
// across tabs, so a single session-pinned org makes "active org" a
// browser-global — two tabs can't be in two orgs at once, and switching in one
// silently re-scopes the other. Scoping per-request from the URL makes each
// tab independent.
