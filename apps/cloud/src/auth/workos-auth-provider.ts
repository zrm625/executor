// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Cloud's identity provider — folds the three former `protected.ts` resolvers
// (`resolveApiKeyPrincipal`, `resolveSessionPrincipal`, `resolveProtectedPrincipal`)
// into one `authenticate(request)` that the shared `ExecutionStackMiddleware`
// consumes. The credential precedence (Bearer api-key BEATS sealed-session
// cookie) stays INSIDE this adapter — it is WorkOS-specific and deliberately not
// abstracted into the shared seam.
//
// Cloud now provides the NEUTRAL `IdentityProvider` tag (same as self-host), not
// a forked one. Each rejected path raises the SHARED identity error carrying the
// SAME machine `code` + `message` it always emitted, so cloud's failure strategy
// reproduces the exact `{ error, code }` JSON bytes at the SAME status:
//   - non-Bearer header          -> Unauthorized  401 invalid_authorization_header
//   - empty Bearer token         -> Unauthorized  401 invalid_api_key
//   - api-key validate outage    -> Unavailable   503 api_key_validation_unavailable
//   - invalid api key            -> Unauthorized  401 invalid_api_key
//   - api-key org not authorized -> NoOrganization 403 no_organization
//   - no/invalid session         -> NoOrganization 403 no_organization
//   - session without org header -> NoOrganization 403 no_organization (fail closed)
//   - session org not authorized -> NoOrganization 403 no_organization
//   - no auth header             -> falls through to the sealed-session path
// The org-resolution infra errors (`UserStoreError` / `WorkOSError`) are
// `Effect.die`d so they surface as 500 defects — the same status the old inline
// resolver produced when those bubbled up.
//
// The per-request `UserStoreService` (read by the org-resolution path) stays a
// REQUIREMENT OF THE LAYER, satisfied by the facade's per-request DB combine —
// NOT a function-level requirement (that is what forced a forked tag before).
