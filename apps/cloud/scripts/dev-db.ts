// `PGLiteSocketServer` defaults to `maxConnections: 1` and answers every extra
// concurrent connection with "Too many connections" + an immediate socket
// close. (pglite-socket 0.1.4's published index.d.ts documents "default: 100",
// but the shipped runtime JS is `maxConnections ?? 1`, verified in the shipped
// chunk, so the runtime default really is 1.) The cloud worker opens a fresh
// postgres pool per request (the MCP auth seam rebuilds one on EVERY `/mcp`
// request, see apps/cloud/src/mcp/auth.ts), so under concurrent load, exactly
// what the e2e suite generates against one shared dev stack, the
// second-and-later connects were rejected, and postgres.js reconnected in a
// tight loop against the closed socket. That reconnect storm piled up
// thousands of half-closed sockets, starved real queries, drove request
// latency into the tens of seconds, and eventually hung the stack: the CI e2e
// "cloud dev stack degrades after minutes of sustained load" cascade flake.
// PGlite runs queries serially (its internal QueryQueueManager executes each
// under `runExclusive`), so allowing many connections means they queue instead
// of being rejected. One caveat makes that safe: stock pglite-socket 0.1.4
// enqueues each wire FRAME separately, so two connections' extended-protocol
// pipelines (Parse/Bind/Execute/Sync) would interleave inside the one shared
// PGlite session and corrupt each other ("bind message supplies N parameters,
// but prepared statement requires M" -> random 500s on whichever request lost
// the race). The patch in patches/@electric-sql%2Fpglite-socket@0.1.4.patch
// batches each socket data event into one queue entry and holds handler
// affinity while a pipeline is open. The patch also fixes the queue's two
// self-bricking failure paths — both surfaced in CI as the e2e "cloud signIn:
// callback set no session (500)" cascade, where new connections' startup
// packets sat unanswered (postgres.js CONNECT_TIMEOUT) until restart:
//   1. Stock 0.1.4 `return`ed out of the drain loop when a query REJECTED at
//      the JS level, leaving its `processing` flag latched true; nothing was
//      ever dequeued again.
//   2. A client whose socket died WHILE its pipeline-opening entry executed:
//      detach() cleared affinity before the entry finished, the queue then
//      took affinity for the already-dead handler, and no timer was left to
//      release it. The queue now tracks detached handlers and repairs any
//      transaction or pipeline affinity they can no longer release.
// src/db/dev-db-socket-concurrency.node.test.ts is the regression test for
// all of the above.

// times out — CONNECT_TIMEOUT — for the rest of the shard). The known paths
// are patched with regression tests, but each recurrence so far has found a
// new path, and a wedged front-end turns ONE infra hiccup into a failure of
// every remaining test in the shard.
//
// So: probe the server the way the app does — a fresh TCP connection, real
// startup handshake, `select 1` — and when several consecutive probes fail,
// dump the server's internals to the boot log and swap in a fresh socket
// server on the same PGlite instance (all state is in PGlite; the front-end is
// stateless, so this drops only already-doomed connections). If a restart
// doesn't restore service, exit non-zero: the boot supervisor logs the exit
// loudly and the run fails fast with an attributable cause instead of minutes
// of anonymous CONNECT_TIMEOUTs. The wedge itself stays visible in the
