// Self-host serves MCP at the bare `/mcp` path (and bare OAuth discovery docs).
// The console "Connect an agent" card, however, prints
// `<origin>/<organizationId>/mcp` — a convention the multi-tenant cloud worker
// routes (it strips the org segment at the edge, carrying the org in a header).
// Self-host is single-tenant: the session already pins the one org, so the org
// segment in the URL carries no routing meaning. Rather than special-case the
// card per host, both self-host front-ends (the prod Bun server and the vite
// dev middleware) strip a single leading segment so the card's URL reaches the
// real route — mirroring cloud's edge rewrite, but accepting ANY segment (a
// Better Auth org id is not the `org_…` shape cloud keys on). Unlike cloud,
// which carries the org in a header for routing, self-host's rewrite carries
// the ORIGINAL org-scoped pathname in `MCP_ORIGINAL_PATH_HEADER` below, purely
// so the protected-resource metadata (./auth.ts) can echo the org-scoped form
// back to a client that dialed org-scoped (RFC 9728 same-origin check).
//
// Pure + Effect-free on purpose: the vite config imports it too.
