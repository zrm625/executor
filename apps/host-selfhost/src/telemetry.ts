// Self-host OTLP export.
//
// The shared packages this server runs are already instrumented — `withSpan`
// wraps tool execution, OAuth, connection health, and storage — but without a
// tracer those spans go nowhere. That is why a slow request on someone else's
// hardware can only be reported as "it takes five seconds": nothing the
// operator can read says which phase the time went to. Pointing this at a local
// collector turns that into a waterfall.
//
// Export is opt-in and off by default. Self-host runs on the operator's own
// machine, so sending their traces anywhere without being asked is not ours to
// decide; the default is no exporter, no HTTP client, no buffer.
//
// This uses Effect's own OTLP modules rather than the OpenTelemetry SDK. Cloud
// needs `@effect/opentelemetry` because workerd forces a hand-built
// WebTracerProvider, but self-host has no such constraint, and the built-in
// path needs only an HttpClient — no `@opentelemetry/*` dependencies, nothing
// extra in the container image.
