// Better Auth instance over the SAME libSQL CONNECTION as the FumaDB executor
// tables ("one connection, two schema regions").
//
// Schema-at-boot: passing `{ dialect: new LibsqlDialect({ client }), type:
// "sqlite" }` makes Better Auth's createKyselyAdapter take its `"dialect" in db`
// branch (no native dep, no bun:sqlite); `runMigrations()` creates the auth
// tables idempotently. `makeAuthOptions` is the single source of truth so the
// migrator and runtime instance never drift.
//
// CRITICAL: LibsqlDialect is handed SelfHostDb's EXISTING `@libsql/client` (the
// `{ client }` config branch), NOT a fresh `{ url }` connection. This is the
// crux of the self-host data-loss fix: libSQL connections each manage their own
// `-wal`/`-shm`, and when Better Auth opened a SECOND connection to the same
// file (`{ url }`), its open unlinked SelfHostDb's `-wal`/`-shm` and created new
// ones — orphaning SelfHostDb onto a now-deleted WAL inode. Every executor-core
// write (integrations, connections, tools) then landed in that deleted inode
// and vanished on the next restart, while Better Auth's own writes (on the live
// WAL) survived — the "reconnected account, zero tools" bug, reproducing even
// after the throwaway-bootstrap-instance fix because the LONG-LIVED auth
// connection unlinked it just the same. Sharing one client means one WAL: no
// unlink, and SelfHostDb's foreign_keys/WAL/busy_timeout PRAGMAs now cover auth
// queries too (same connection). `{ client }` sets closeClient=false, so the
// dialect never closes the handle — SelfHostDb owns the file lifecycle and
// closes its client at shutdown. NEVER call .destroy() during normal operation.
//
// We build exactly ONE auth instance, held for the process lifetime. An earlier
// design also built a throwaway "bootstrap" instance (discarded mid-boot); that
// is gone too — the org id is late-bound the same way the signup gate's
// `getAuth` already is, so no second instance is ever needed.
//
// `satisfies BetterAuthOptions` (not a return annotation) keeps the literal
// plugin tuple so `betterAuth` infers the plugin-augmented `auth.api` and
// session/user shapes (activeOrganizationId, role, createUser, ...).
