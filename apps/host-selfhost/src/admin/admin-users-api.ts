// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Self-host admin users API — the shared, provider-neutral `AdminUsersHandlers`
// backed by a Better-Auth-authorized platform view, mounted at
// `/api/admin/users*` beside the existing invite-code admin routes.
//
// AUTH: an owner/admin member of the single org, resolved by the shared
// `requireInstanceAdmin` — the SAME gate the invite-code admin API uses
// (`admin/handlers.ts`), not a new permission concept. Membership is resolved
// against the INSTANCE's organization id, never the caller's
// `session.activeOrganizationId`: see require-admin.ts for the privilege
// escalation that distinction refuses. Self-host has no
// organization-OWNED api key (Better Auth keys always belong to the user who
// created one), so there is no machine-credential path here; the operator's own
// admin session is the credential. That asymmetry with cloud is deliberate and
// is why `AdminUsersProvider` is a seam rather than one shared implementation.
//
// The READ half is identical to cloud's: a subject-less, tenant-reach executor
// from `makePlatformExecutor`, projected by the shared `admin/reads`. Self-host
// is single-tenant, so the tenant is always the boot-seeded org.
