// self-contained: no daemon to manage, no HTTP token.
//
// Run the daemon FROM SOURCE (bun apps/cli/bin/executor.ts) so the shell
// resource is served from packages/hosts/mcp-apps-shell/dist/mcp-app.html
// (`pretest` builds it). The compiled binary also ships the shell, but source
// is the cheapest path for a test.
