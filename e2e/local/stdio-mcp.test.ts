// Repro + regression guard for the user report: "On a totally fresh install
// (no existing data dir) on macOS, Executor does not detect any tools for a
// STDIO MCP server."
//
// `withLocalServer` boots a real `executor web` on a THROWAWAY data dir (the
// fresh-install condition) and the `local` app is the only surface that enables
// stdio MCP (`dangerouslyAllowStdioMCP: true`). We add a stdio MCP server over
// the bearer-authed API and assert its tools are discoverable — and that the
// secret env it needs is stored on the connection (the secret store), not in
// the integration's config blob.
//
// The original bug: `mcp.addServer` only registered an INTEGRATION. Per the
// v1.5 integrations/connections split, tools are produced per-CONNECTION, and a
// stdio add never created one, so the integration landed with zero connections
// and zero tools. The fix auto-creates the default connection on add and routes
// the env values into the connection's secret store.
//
// The scenario also covers what ELSE reaches that subprocess. A stdio server
// that declared any `env` used to be spawned with `{ ...process.env, ...env }`,
// so it received every variable the daemon holds — including the key that
// decrypts the secret store. `withLocalServer`'s `env` option plants two
// variables on the real daemon process (see DAEMON_ENV) and the fixture reports
// which of them survived the spawn, so the boundary is measured on the product
// path rather than at the call site of the transport.
