// The desktop system-browser OAuth flow: the renderer cannot receive a
// postMessage from the user's external browser, so it asks the local server
// for the result at `/api/oauth/await/:sessionId`. Guarantee under test: the
// server LONG-POLLS that route — a request issued while the flow is still in
// flight is held open and answered the instant the provider callback
// completes, instead of answered `null` (which made the renderer wait up to a
// full 1s poll tick with the result already sitting in memory).
//
// The journey, against a real `executor web` boot:
//
//   1. `oauth.start` a connect → the await sessionId (= `started.state`).
//   2. Issue an await BEFORE the provider callback. It must be held open — a
//      pre-long-poll server answers `null` immediately, which this scenario
//      rejects explicitly. A SECOND await for the same session must answer
//      `null` instantly instead of holding: held waiters are capped at one
//      per session, so an unpatched 1s-interval client degrades to exactly
//      the old poll behavior instead of stacking held connections.
//   3. Complete the provider consent and land the REAL `/api/oauth/callback`
//      redirect (the path that publishes the result and wakes waiters).
//   4. The held request resolves promptly (well under the old 1s poll tick)
//      and carries the ok result — single-consumer delivery of the one-shot
//      result.
