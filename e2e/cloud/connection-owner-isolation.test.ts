// Cloud-only: the connection OWNER model, with real multi-user organizations.
// Every connection is filed under `owner: "org"` (shared with the whole tenant)
// or `owner: "user"` (this subject's own). The org membership is built through
// the real product flows — invite → accept-invitation, create-organization,
// switch-organization — so the guarantees hold for genuine sessions:
//
//   1. A user-owned connection is private to its creator, even from co-workers
//      in the same org (personal OAuth tokens don't leak to colleagues).
//   2. An org-owned connection IS visible to every member of that org — one
//      admin pasting a shared API key serves the whole tenant.
//   3. The same account in two orgs is two separate credential spaces.
