// Cloud-only: the OWNER's view of a workspace — `/api/admin/users*`. The
// product plane answers "what can I, this member, reach"; this plane answers
// "who uses my workspace, and what have they connected", reading across every
// member of the tenant instead of binding to one.
//
// Two members are built through the REAL flows (login → create-organization →
// invite → accept-invitation), each connects their own Personal credential, and
// the admin then reads the joined view — the exact shape a customer dashboard's
// icon grid consumes. The guarantees pinned here:
//
//   1. the joined view reports BOTH members and each one's own connections,
//      even though no single product-view caller can see another member's;
//   2. it never carries credential material;
//   3. a plain member is refused (403) and an anonymous caller too (401);
//   4. another tenant's admin sees none of it.
//
// EMULATOR GAP: the WorkOS emulator hardcodes `owner.type: "user"` in its api-key
// serializer and exposes no organization-key mint route, so an org-scoped API
// key — the machine credential for this plane — cannot exist end-to-end here.
// This scenario therefore drives the ADMIN SESSION path, which is the other
// credential the plane accepts. The org-key half is covered at unit level in
// `apps/cloud/src/auth/org-api-key-mint.node.test.ts` (against the real WorkOS
// response shape) and `org-api-key-auth.node.test.ts` (PlatformAuth resolution).
