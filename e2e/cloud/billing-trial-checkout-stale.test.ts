// Cloud-only (billing, browser): completing the Team free-trial checkout should
// leave the billing page showing the new plan WITHOUT a manual reload, and
// without ever flashing the stale upgrade CTA.
//
// Guards a reported bug + its fix: a user starts the free trial, completes
// Stripe checkout, and is redirected back to the plans page. The redirect lands
// before Autumn has processed Stripe's webhook, and autumn-js fetches the
// customer once on load (staleTime 60s, refetchOnWindowFocus off), so the page
// used to show the old plan and the "Start free trial" CTA until a manual
// reload. The fix tags the checkout return URL with the purchased plan, then on
// return shows that plan as "Activating" while it refetches until the webhook
// lands, resolving to "Your plan" with no reload.
//
// The emulator models the race faithfully: completing the hosted checkout
// redirects back immediately but does NOT activate the subscription; activation
// lands only when the webhook settles (autumn.settleCheckout), which this test
// triggers to control the exact moment the backend becomes consistent.
