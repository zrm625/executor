// Cloud-only: the connect deep link's REASON FOR CARRYING AN ORG SLUG.
//
// An operator on the admin Users page copies a connect link for a member who
// hasn't connected something yet and sends it to them. `connectLinkUrl` builds
// that link org-PREFIXED (`/<org>/connect/<slug>`) rather than bare, and the
// failure that choice prevents is specific and silent: a recipient who belongs
// to several workspaces has ONE session-default org, and a bare `/connect/x`
// resolves against THAT one. They would land in the wrong workspace, connect a
// real credential there, and nothing anywhere would report a problem — the
// connection succeeds, it is just in the wrong tenant. The sender then keeps
// seeing an unconnected user.
//
// The existing coverage cannot catch this. `scenarios/connect-deep-link.test.ts`
// deliberately accepts EITHER URL form (it runs on hosts with and without an
// org segment) and its user belongs to one org, so both forms resolve to the
// same place. `packages/react/src/routes/connect-deep-link.test.ts` only proves
// the router parses the param. Neither has a second org to land in by mistake.
//
// So: a recipient who is a plain member of TWO orgs, whose session defaults to
// org B, follows an org-A-scoped link. The request must open the forced-Personal
// connection flow in org A — never enter a connection flow in B.
//
// Both orgs register an integration under the SAME slug — that is what makes
// this a real test. With distinct slugs, org B's catalog would simply not
// contain the link's slug and the page would show its not-found state, so the
// scenario would pass for the wrong reason (a lookup miss rather than correct
// scoping). Sharing the slug means BOTH orgs can satisfy the link, and only the
// org prefix decides which one does.
