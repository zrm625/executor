// Cloud-only (billing): the free plan advertises "Up to 3 members", 3
// INCLUSIVE. A fresh org's admin holds seat 1, so two invites fill seats 2 and
// 3; at that point "Invite member" opens an upgrade prompt (linking to billing)
// instead of the invite form, and a direct call to the invite endpoint is
// refused with a message that names the real reason.
//
// Regression for a Replo report: an admin (sole member, one invite already
// pending) could not invite another teammate and got the generic "Failed to
// send invitation. Please try again." Root cause: the seat count summed
// `listOrganizationMemberships` (which includes the invited user as a PENDING
// membership) and `listInvitations` (the SAME invited user), double-counting
// every outstanding invite, so a 1-member org with 1 pending invite read as 3
// seats used. Two UI gaps compounded it: the invite button stayed enabled at
// the cap, and the 403 was masked behind a generic, retry-implying message.
//
// The dedupe itself is unit-tested in `apps/cloud/src/extensions/billing/
// plans.test.ts`. This scenario covers the user-facing flow end to end: invited
// people appear as pending members, the cap turns "Invite member" into an
// upgrade prompt, and the endpoint refuses with a reason.
