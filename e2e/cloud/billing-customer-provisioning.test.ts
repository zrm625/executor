// Cloud-only (billing): an organization must EXIST as a customer at the billing
// provider, or every billing call for it answers `customer_not_found` forever.
//
// That state is invisible from the product side and catastrophic underneath it:
// the balance gate fails open (by design — a billing outage must not stop
// executions), and usage tracking is fire-and-forget, so the org runs unlimited
// executions and NONE of them reach the meter. The product looks perfectly
// healthy while every execution is unbilled and unmetered.
//
// Three guarantees are pinned here, all read from Autumn's own state rather than
// from the execution's response (which can never show any of them):
//
//   1. creating an organization provisions its billing customer up front,
//   2. if a customer is missing anyway, the billing seam heals it in place and
//      the execution still lands on the meter, and
//   3. any OTHER billing failure is left alone — the repair is scoped to the
//      "no such customer" answer, so a real provider failure is still reported
//      rather than quietly retried away.
//
// The missing customer is produced with the emulator's fault injector — one
// 404 `customer_not_found` per billing endpoint — because the emulator, like
// real Autumn's SDK flow, otherwise auto-creates customers on contact.
