// Cloud: crossing the isolate's resident-runtime soft cap evicts an idle
// session's runtime through a REAL cross-Durable-Object request, not a
// same-context call.
//
// The defect this pins: the original design ran the evicted (candidate)
// session's teardown — closing its postgres.js socket, storage writes, span
// flush — directly inside the EVICTING session's own request/IoContext. In
// production workerd, I/O objects are bound to the IoContext that created
// them, so a cross-context call like that throws "Cannot perform I/O on
// behalf of a different request" or silently soft-fails. That failure mode
// cannot reproduce against an in-process unit-test double (same JS object,
// same context either way) — it only shows up against a real Durable Object
// stub. The fix routes eviction through the candidate's OWN stub
// (`requestCapEviction`, an RPC method mirroring `forwardModelResumeToOwner`),
// so the candidate's teardown runs in the candidate's own context, and this
// scenario is what actually exercises that stub in workerd.
//
// e2e/setup/resident-runtime-cap.ts lowers MCP_RESIDENT_RUNTIME_SOFT_CAP for
// the whole boot (see that file for the value and its headroom story), so
// this test can cross it with a bounded number of real sessions instead of
// registering the production default of 32.

 * way separate browser tabs sharing one login would — so many of these under
 * one identity is a cheap way to grow the isolate's resident-runtime count
 * without a full OAuth round trip per session.
 *
 * `recordSession` is called the moment the session id is known — before the
 * `notifications/initialized` round trip below, not after this function
 * returns. A session is live on the server as soon as `initialize` responds
 * with an `mcp-session-id`, regardless of whether the handshake ever
 * completes; recording it only on a full return left a failed notification
 * (or an interrupt landing between the two requests) with no cleanup entry,
 * orphaning a real session on the target isolate.
