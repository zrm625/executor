// Cloud: a refreshed OAuth credential has to be PERSISTED, and persisting it is
// a pair of version-checked writes into WorkOS Vault — the rotated refresh
// token and the new access token, one after the other, not atomically. Three
// production failures live in that gap.
//
//  1. Contention. Two concurrent probes of one connection each run a refresh and
//     each write the same two objects, so a version-checked write comes back 409
//     ("Current version does not match expected version"). A write that retries
//     with no wait re-collides inside the peer's own round trip, drains its
//     attempts in microseconds, and the refresh fails outright — the user saw a
//     500 on a connection health request.
//  2. Ordering. If the write that fails is the one carrying the rotated refresh
//     token, the credential is gone for good: minting already spent the refresh
//     token we sent, so nothing can mint again and every later use of the
//     connection comes back `invalid_grant`. The access token, by contrast, is
//     disposable — one more grant re-mints it.
//  3. Writability. Ordering bounds the damage but cannot remove it: when the
//     store refuses writes outright, a grant that has already run has spent the
//     stored refresh token and there is nowhere to put its successor. The
//     refresh must therefore be gated on a store that is proven writable BEFORE
//     the grant, so a storage outage costs the user nothing but the wait. The
//     gate writes an object of its own that holds no credential — proving the
//     store on the refresh token's own object would mean writing a value read
//     moments earlier, which is how a peer's rotated token gets overwritten.
//
// Both are pinned here at the product surface, black box. Failures are armed on
// the WorkOS emulator that the product's own WorkOS client talks to; no product
// code, stubs, or internals are touched. Contention is modelled twice, because
// the two halves of the write policy fail differently: by a COUNT of collisions
// (does the loop have enough attempts, and does it still land the value when it
// runs out?) and by a WINDOW of time (does it wait long enough between attempts
// to still be trying when the peer lets go?). Every scenario also reads the
// emulator's ledger back to prove the collisions it armed were really served —
// a fault whose pattern stopped matching would otherwise leave a test that
// passes without ever contending.
