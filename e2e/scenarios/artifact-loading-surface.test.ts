// Opening an artifact shows ONE loading surface, not three.
//
// ## What went wrong
//
// Opening an artifact used to walk through three visually distinct placeholders
// in quick succession, each in its own layout and each visible for a few hundred
// milliseconds:
//
//   1. "Loading artifact…"        — the row being fetched, small corner text
//   2. "Preparing the renderer…"  — the lazy chunk arriving, a different corner
//   3. "Preparing interactive UI" — the shell booting, a card in the middle
//
// Those are executor's own internal boundaries — an HTTP request, a code-split
// point, an iframe handshake — and none of them is a fact a person opening a
// saved dashboard has any use for. What they produced was churn: three
// different things flashing in three different places. Three quick loading
// states are worse than one longer one, because every transition is a fresh
// demand on the eye.
//
// ## What is asserted, and why it is asserted this way
//
// The honest test of "the user never saw a placeholder" is not a screenshot at
// one moment — the states this is about were only ever visible for a few
// hundred milliseconds, so any single sample would miss them and pass against
// the old code too. So the page is SAMPLED CONTINUOUSLY, from before navigation
// until the artifact is live, and the assertion is over everything that was ever
// on screen:
//
//   - none of the three placeholder texts ever appeared;
//   - the stage's bounding box never moved, so nothing was ever laid out twice.
//
// Both directions are covered, because they fail differently: warm (from the
// gallery, renderer chunk already fetched) and cold (a direct URL in a fresh
// context, nothing cached).
