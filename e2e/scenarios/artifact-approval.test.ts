// Cross-target: approving a destructive action triggered from inside an
// artifact.
//
// This is the console's own path, not MCP. The artifact page has no MCP client,
// so the shell's host adapter posts `POST /executions` (with the artifact id)
// and then `POST /executions/:id/resume` when the human answers the modal. The
// existing approval coverage all runs over MCP, where the engine lives for the
// lifetime of a session Durable Object — so none of it could see that on a host
// building an executor per request the pause and the resume land on DIFFERENT
// engine instances, and the approval failed with `ExecutionNotFoundError`.
//
// Two things are asserted that the older scenarios could not:
//
//   1. The approval is honoured at all on this path, and the side effect lands.
//   2. It is still honoured after a human-scale delay. The reported symptom was
//      an approval that took "tens of seconds", so a scenario approving
//      instantly would stay green against the broken code. It is worth being
//      precise about why: the bug is NOT time-based (a resume 7ms after the
//      pause failed identically), so the delay is not what makes this catch the
//      regression — the artifact-scoped path is. The delay guards the separate
//      promise that an approval window is human-scale.
