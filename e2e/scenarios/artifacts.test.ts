// Cross-target: the artifacts journey, end to end.
//
// An agent on a client that cannot display MCP Apps calls `create-artifact`. The
// product promise under test is vision.md's delivery negotiation: the model
// behaves identically either way, and only DELIVERY changes — a client without
// MCP Apps gets a deep link into the web app instead of an embedded widget.
// Persistence is what makes that possible, so the same artifact must then be
// reachable three ways: the deep link, the Artifacts tab, and back through MCP
// by title.
//
// Two scenarios, split by what they prove:
//   1. create-artifact saves + delivers a working deep link, and the page renders
//      the component live (the fallback path a non-Apps client actually walks).
//   2. Rename and delete in the console are what MCP reads back afterwards
//      (the console and the agent share one store, not two caches).
