// Cross-target: the Run/Test panel's backend (`POST /executions`) auto-approves
// approval-gated tools when the operator invokes them, because clicking Run in
// the panel IS the human approval.
//
// The panel sends `autoApprove: true`. Here we drive the same HTTP endpoint the
// panel uses and prove both halves of the contract against ONE tool that gates
// itself: the `policies.create` core tool carries a `requiresApproval`
// annotation, so with no matching policy in play the annotation is the only
// thing that can pause the call.
//
//   - without `autoApprove`: the call pauses (the panel would have dead-ended
//     on "This tool requires approval"), and the policy is not written.
//   - with `autoApprove`: the call runs to completion and the policy is written.
//
// The created policy is a `block` rule on a unique, non-matching pattern, so a
// leak cannot gate another scenario's tools; it is removed in an `ensuring`
// finalizer regardless.
