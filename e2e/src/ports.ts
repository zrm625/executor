// birthday-paradox territory) — the globalsetups call `claimPorts`, which
// probes the preferred block and walks forward to the next fully-free one,
// then publishes the claimed ports via the E2E_*_PORT env vars so vitest's
// test workers (spawned after globalsetup) compute the same URLs. The
// collision failure mode this kills is brutal: vite's --strictPort exit is
// swallowed by the boot glue and waitForHttp happily attaches to the OTHER
// checkout's server, failing dozens of scenarios with baffling auth errors
// instead of one clear bind error. Individual E2E_*_PORT env vars still
// override everything, and E2E_<TARGET>_URL still attaches to a running

// that no other suite triggered. A connect-probe can't see such a squatter

// Bind-probe a single port and hold the listeners: resolves the held servers

//
// 1. Connect-probe the loopbacks (127.0.0.1 and ::1). On macOS a specific-
//    address listener (a leaked vite dev server on 127.0.0.1, or selfhost's
//    ::1) coexists with a wildcard bind, so the bind-probes below can't see
//    it — but a connect can. Runs FIRST because once our own wildcard probes
//    are up they would answer loopback connects themselves. Persistent
//    listeners are what this catches, so its check-vs-use gap is harmless.
// 2. Bind 0.0.0.0 — catches v4 squatters, including ephemeral OUTBOUND
//    sockets, which no connect-probe can see (nothing is listening).
// 3. Bind :: with ipv6Only — catches v6 squatters. ipv6Only is load-bearing:
//    a plain `::` bind is DUAL-STACK on Linux (ipv6Only defaults to false),
//    so it also claims the v4 side and EADDRINUSEs against our OWN 0.0.0.0
//    probe from step 2, rejecting every block; the v6-ONLY side never
//    overlaps the v4 side, so this pair coexists on both Linux and macOS
//    (verified empirically on both). Sequential on purpose: the second bind
//    must observe the first, not race it.
//
// The caller holds every probe server until the whole block is proven free,
// then closes them the instant before the real services bind — shrinking the
// time-of-check/time-of-use window from seconds (probe, then boot) to
// microseconds (close, then boot). Services bind 127.0.0.1 or dual-stack `::`,
// both of which succeed once the probes are released.
