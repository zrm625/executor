// Autumn surface: read the usage events the target ACTUALLY tracked to its

// ledger, not in the execution's own response. This surface reads that ledger
// from the suite's Autumn emulator: the layer where a "we silently stopped
// metering" regression (the unmetered MCP plane these scenarios pin) is actually
// observable. A missing track looks identical to health from the product side,
// so the contract has to be pinned where the usage is read.
