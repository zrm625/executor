 * every browser session exports OTel spans to the run's motel through
 * packages/react's `OtlpTracer` on a one-second interval (wired by
 * `setup/motel.ts` via VITE_PUBLIC_OTLP_TRACES_URL). A page that keeps
 * producing spans — a console retrying an org-scoped query that 403s, say —
 * feeds that exporter indefinitely, so the 500ms window never opens and the
 * wait burns its full timeout on a page that is, visibly, completely loaded.
 *
 * The quiet is worth waiting for when it comes (it usually arrives in
 * milliseconds, and it lets a step's screenshot catch a settled page), so keep
 * it — bounded. Readiness is asserted by whatever the scenario does next:
 * Playwright's locators auto-wait, so `getByRole(...).waitFor()` is a real,
 * page-specific readiness signal where `networkidle` was only ever a proxy.

 * live root rather than inert HTML. That matters because it is the line either
 * side of which an interaction has a different meaning: before it, a click or
 * a `fill` goes to markup nobody is listening to and is lost without a trace;
 * after it, React records the event and replays it as hydration reaches that
 * subtree. Locators can't see the difference — the element is visible and
 * enabled either way — which is why a swallowed interaction surfaces 20
 * seconds later as "the thing it should have opened never appeared".
