/**
 * Asserts that patched dependencies are actually installed in patched form.
 *
 * We patch several npm packages via `bun patch` (see `patchedDependencies` in
 * package.json and the `patches/*.patch` files). At least one of these patches
 * is load-bearing at runtime, not just a build-time convenience: the
 * `agents@0.17.3` patch carries the MCP transport persist/replay fix (the SSE
 * "hang" fix that preserves tool results across dropped connections). If the
 * installed `agents` dist is the STALE, unpatched upstream build, everything
 * still compiles and tests mostly pass while the deployed transport silently
 * lacks the fix, so prod ships the pre-fix transport with zero signal.
 *
 * This has actually happened: a bun cache edge case left a checkout with an
 * unpatched `agents` dist in node_modules even though the lockfile and
 * package.json recorded the patch. `bun install` reported no changes because
 * the store entry it wanted was already present; it just wasn't the patched
 * content.
 *
 * So we don't trust the lockfile — we read the installed dist off disk and
 * assert the post-patch sentinel strings are present. The check is a couple of
 * file reads plus greps, so it adds ~zero wall-clock time and is safe to run in
 * CI before the test job and in `bootstrap` on every fresh checkout.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run scripts/check-patched-deps.ts
 *
 * Env overrides (used by the self-test):
 *   CHECK_PATCHED_DEPS_AGENTS_MCP=/abs/path/to/agents/dist/mcp/index.js
 *     Force the agents MCP entry path instead of resolving it, so the self-test
 *     can point the check at a deliberately-corrupted copy.
