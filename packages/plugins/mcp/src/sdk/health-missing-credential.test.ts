// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// A health check must not report `healthy` for a connection whose credential is
// missing.
//
// Rendering SKIPS a placement whose value is unresolved — that is the renderer's
// documented behaviour, and callers own the policy. The invoke path already
// refuses (it names "dialing unauthenticated" as the thing it is avoiding), and
// the OpenAPI health check reports `expired`. The MCP health check had neither,
// so it dialled unauthenticated, and any server that lists tools without auth
// answered — reporting a connection with no credential as healthy.
//
// That matters more than an ordinary wrong status: health is the signal telling
// a user to re-authenticate, so `healthy` is the one answer it must never give
// when the credential is gone.
//
// Driven against the plugin's own `checkHealth` rather than through a live
// connection, because the precondition under test — a connection that EXISTS but
// whose credential does not resolve — is exactly the state the connection APIs
// are designed to prevent you from creating. Calling the seam directly is the
// only way to construct it without faking the thing being tested.
