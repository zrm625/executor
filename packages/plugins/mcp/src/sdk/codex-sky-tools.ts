// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The Codex "Computer Use" tool surface.
//
// Computer Use is NOT a plain MCP server in current Codex: its plugin ships as
// a `node-repl` content variant, so Codex never starts the `computer-use`
// server (asking for it answers "unknown MCP server"). What actually drives a
// Mac is the `node_repl` server's `js` tool running the plugin's bundled
// `@oai/sky` package — that is what ChatGPT itself does, and Codex tags those
// calls `toolSurface: { kind: "computerUse" }`.
//
// Handing an agent a raw JavaScript REPL would be a poor tool catalog: it
// moves the whole API contract into prose and makes every call a code-writing
// exercise. So the bridge projects `@oai/sky` as ordinary, typed MCP tools —
// one per method, with real input schemas — and compiles each call back into
// the one `node_repl.js` execution that performs it. Callers see
// `list_apps` / `click` / `type_text`; the REPL stays an implementation
// detail.
//
// The surface below mirrors the `Sky` type in the plugin's own SKILL.md.
