 * stdio server sits behind the same corporate proxy and the same intercepting
 * CA as the process that spawned it, and those paths commonly live outside the
 * OS trust store. Dropping them makes every HTTPS call from every stdio server
 * fail on such a network. None of them carries a credential.
 *
 * Deliberately short and closed. Anything else a server needs — an API key
 * above all — is declared on the source config's `env`, which is the mechanism
 * that already exists for exactly that, and which wins on a key collision.

 * Combine the inherited allowlist with the source config's declared `env`,

 *
 * On Windows an environment key is case-insensitive: `Path` and `PATH` name one
 * variable. A JavaScript spread is case-sensitive on every platform, so a plain
 * merge can emit two spellings of the same variable — inherited `HTTP_PROXY`
 * beside a declared `http_proxy`, or the SDK's `PATH` beside a declared `Path`.
 * Both then reach the child's environment block, and the child reads whichever
 * Windows resolves first rather than the one the config declared. Precedence
 * that reads correctly in the source is silently lost at the boundary.
 *
 * So on `win32` this merges by case-insensitive key identity. The declared env
 * still wins, and the losing spelling is dropped instead of travelling beside
 * the winner. A key that collides with one the SDK sets is emitted with the
 * SDK's spelling, because the SDK spreads its own safe-list underneath this
 * result: matching its spelling replaces that entry, while a different spelling
 * would only add an alias next to it.
 *
 * On every other platform the keys are genuinely case-sensitive, and this is a
 * plain merge.
