// Shared console routes come from @executor-js/react (see its
// console-routes.ts); this app owns its root and the local-specific routes
// under src/routes/app. /secrets is excluded: the local app's variant shows
// credential-provider info. /users is excluded because local serves no account
// or admin API at all (see apps/local/src/app.ts) — there is no tenant to
// operate and no endpoint behind the page. App routes mount INSIDE the shared
// `{-$orgSlug}` scope (local never sets the param, so URLs stay bare) so the
// override masks the shared route id.
