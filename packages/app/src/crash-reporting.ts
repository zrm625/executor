/**
 * Desktop-only renderer crash reporting.
 *
 * This bundle is served identically to `executor web`, self-host, and the
 * desktop app, so nothing is baked in at build time. Inside the desktop app
 * the preload bridge (`window.executor`) hands over a DSN at runtime —
 * everywhere else the bridge is absent (or returns null in DSN-less builds)
 * and Sentry is never imported, let alone initialized.
 *
 * Handled UI errors are reported through `reportRendererHandledError`, which
 * the root route hands to `ExecutorProvider`. Letting them fall through to
 * `globalThis.reportError` instead — as this module used to — filed them via
 * Sentry's global `onerror` handler, i.e. as UNHANDLED crashes, with the
 * surface/action context dropped on the floor. Until the DSN arrives (and in
 * every build without one) the global-event fallback still applies, so nothing
 * is lost in self-host.
