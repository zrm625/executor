// PendingApprovalStore — durable "this call is waiting on a human" records.
//
// A paused execution normally lives as a suspended fiber inside one engine
// instance. That works whenever the pause and the resume are served by the same
// engine (local and desktop, which share one boot-built executor, and any
// same-instance resume elsewhere). It does NOT work on a host whose HTTP API
// builds a fresh executor per request: the fiber is discarded with the request
// that created it, so the resume arrives at an engine that has never heard of
// the execution. That is the whole of the artifact-approval bug — the failure is
// immediate, not a lease expiring.
//
// An artifact action is reconstructible where general code is not. The shell's
// grammar is exactly ONE tool call (`parseToolCallCode`), and the approval gate
// runs strictly BEFORE the tool is invoked, so a paused artifact action holds no
// partial work — only a resolved call that has not happened yet. Recording that
// call durably and running it when the approval arrives is therefore equivalent
// to resuming the fiber, without requiring the fiber to still exist.
//
// Records live in the existing owner-scoped `blob` table (no new table, no
// migration). They are single-use: consumed on resume, so one approval authorizes
// exactly one invocation and a replayed resume cannot re-run the call.
