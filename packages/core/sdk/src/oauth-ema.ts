// Enterprise-Managed Authorization (EMA) — the client half.

// MCP "Enterprise-Managed Authorization" profiles
// draft-ietf-oauth-identity-assertion-authz-grant-04 for the case where the MCP
// client and the MCP server share an enterprise IdP. Instead of walking the
// user through per-server consent, the client:
//
//   1. holds an identity assertion from SSO with the IdP,
//   2. exchanges it at the IdP for an Identity Assertion JWT Authorization
//      Grant (ID-JAG) naming the MCP server's authorization server (§4.3), and
//   3. redeems that ID-JAG at the Resource Authorization Server for an access
//      token bound to the MCP server (§4.4).
//
// The IdP evaluates administrator policy at step 2, which is the whole point of
// the profile (§7.2): the enterprise decides which users may reach which
// servers with which scopes. That makes the error taxonomy below load-bearing
// rather than cosmetic — see `EmaPolicyDenied`.
//
// This module owns the chain only. Discovery lives in `./oauth-discovery`, the
// two token-endpoint round trips in `./oauth-helpers`, and persistence in the
// executor's credential lifecycle.

// Rollout gate
//
// Enterprise-managed authorization is shipped behind a host-owned rollout gate.
// The SDK declares the PORT and stays vendor-free: no feature-flag service, no
// analytics client, no network dependency of its own. A host that has one
// injects an implementation through `OAuthServiceDeps`; a host that has none
// (desktop, CLI, local, self-hosted) injects nothing and the profile behaves
// exactly as it did before the gate existed.
//
// Two properties are load-bearing and are pinned by tests
// (`oauth-ema-rollout.test.ts`):
//
//   1. The gate is consulted EXACTLY ONCE per connect, BEFORE discovery, and
//      NEVER after the IdP has spoken. A policy denial that could be re-routed
//      through a flag check would turn the flag into an escape hatch around the
//      very enterprise control this profile exists to enforce.
//
//   2. The gate is a CONNECT-time decision only. It is recorded on the
//      connection (`ENTERPRISE_MANAGED_PROVIDER_STATE_KEY`) and the
//      credential-refresh path follows the stored state, never the gate. So
//      turning the flag off stops NEW enterprise-managed connects and leaves
//      every existing managed connection renewing untouched — and no
//      third-party network dependency ever enters credential resolution.
