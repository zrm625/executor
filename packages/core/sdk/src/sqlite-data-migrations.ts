// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Stamped data-migration ledger for the SQLite-backed hosts (local,
// selfhost, Cloudflare D1). PostgreSQL cloud runs schema + data migrations
// through its drizzle chain out-of-band; the SQLite hosts run them at boot —
// and before this ledger existed, each one re-scanned its tables on every
// startup to decide "did I already run?" by data shape.
// That accumulates (N migrations = N full-table scans per boot, forever)
// and makes idempotence a per-migration proof obligation.
//
// This is the rail instead: a `data_migration` table (name → completion
// time), an ordered registry the app composes, and a runner that executes
// each pending migration once and stamps it. Stamped names are skipped
// without touching the data.
//
// Write migrations idempotently anyway (defense in depth — the support
// remedy for a half-applied state is deleting the stamp row and
// rebooting). One deliberate semantics change from the scan-every-boot
// era: after a migration is stamped, rows written later by an OLDER binary
// (downgrade, then re-upgrade) are NOT re-healed. That matches the cloud
// chain's semantics; the stamp row, not the data shape, is the source of
// truth.
