// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// OAuth service implementation — the runtime behind `executor.oauth` and
// `ctx.oauth`.
//
// v2 model: a client is a registered app carrying its own endpoints; running
// its flow mints a Connection. The client + in-flight session rows are
// owner-scoped core tables; minted access tokens persist through the default
// writable credential provider; tools are produced by `mintOAuthConnection`
// (which the executor wires to the connection-create + tool-production path).
//
// Milestone 2: `start` / `complete` are wired. `start` generates PKCE + a
// branded state, persists an `oauth_session`, and returns the authorize URL
// (authorization_code) or exchanges client credentials immediately. `complete`
// redeems the session, exchanges the code, and mints the connection.
