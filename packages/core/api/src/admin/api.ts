// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Admin Users HTTP API — the public, tenant-wide operator surface.
//
// The product plane (`/api/*`) answers "what can I, this member, reach". This
// one answers the OWNER's question: "who are my users, and what have they
// connected". It reads the SDK's platform view (`executor.admin`, opt-in via
// `platformView: true`), which is read-only by construction — the owner policy
// rejects writes at `reach: "tenant"` — so every endpoint here is a GET.
//
// VOCABULARY: this is the translation seam. Internal code says subject / tenant
// / reach; everything public-facing says users / owners. `AdminSubject
// .externalId` becomes `externalId` on a `users` collection, and nothing below
// leaks the word "subject".
//
// FIELD DISCIPLINE: the response shapes are 1:1 with the SDK's hand-picked
// admin allowlist (`AdminSubject` / `AdminConnection`), NOT a projection of the
// underlying rows. No credential material of any kind may appear — no item ids,
// no refresh ids, no oauth client secrets, no tokens. `oauthScope` is a summary
// of ACCESS (which scopes were granted), never a token. Adding a field here is
// a deliberate act that has to be argued against `platform-view.test.ts`'s
// forbidden-field list.
//
// The allowlist is applied per FIELD, not per column: a column may be allowed
// while the object inside it is not. `lastHealth` is the live case — the SDK's
// `HealthCheckResult` carries upstream-derived content (`identity`, `detail`,
// `responseSample`), so this contract narrows it to `AdminConnectionHealth`
// rather than forwarding the nested object. Any future nested field arrives
// under the same rule: project it, don't re-export it.
//
// Auth is applied by each host's own admin middleware (cloud: an org-scoped API
// key or an admin session member; self-host: a Better Auth owner/admin member),
// so this contract carries no provider-specific auth scheme — the same shape
// the Account API uses.

 * The admin plane's view of a stored health verdict — a deliberate PROJECTION

 * WHY THIS IS ITS OWN SCHEMA. `HealthCheckResult` is the OWNER's view of their
 * own probe, and it carries content lifted from the upstream provider's actual
 * response: `identity` (the display value extracted from `identityField` —
 * typically the account's email AT THE PROVIDER), `detail` (a raw diagnostic
 * message, which for an HTTP failure can quote the upstream body), and
 * `responseSample` (up to 25 scalar leaves of the real response body, ~120
 * chars each, via `extractResponseFields`). That is fine on the product plane,
 * where the caller IS the credential's owner. It is not fine here: this plane
 * reports on OTHER people's connections, so forwarding the whole nested object
 * would hand an operator another user's upstream account identity and sampled
 * response content. The per-column allowlist in `admin/reads.ts` cannot catch
 * that on its own — it allowlists the COLUMN and then forwards everything
 * inside it — so the narrowing is expressed here, in the contract.
 *
 * WHAT SURVIVES. `status` answers the only question this plane asks ("is it
 * healthy"), and `checkedAt` says how stale that answer is. Both are derived
 * verdicts about the connection, never content from the provider's response.
 * `httpStatus` is deliberately dropped as well: it is a diagnostic for the
 * credential's owner, and adding fields here has to be argued against the
 * forbidden-field lists in `platform-view.test.ts` and `admin-users.test.ts`.

 * a path parameter is for, and it keeps "fetch the user I am asking about" as
 * one route with one response schema and one 404.
 *
 * DISAMBIGUATION is by shape — an identifier containing "@" is tried as an
 * email — but that is a ROUTING HINT, not a parse of the id. `externalId` is
 * opaque by contract, so the resolver falls back to a literal id lookup when
 * the email interpretation matches nothing. No host mints an id containing
 * "@" today (cloud: `user_...`; self-host: a Better Auth id; sentinels like
 * "local"), so the fallback is a safety net rather than a live path — but it

// not a silently-ignored filter and not a value handed to the driver.
//
// `isInt` is load-bearing, not decoration: `FiniteFromString` alone accepts
// "1.5", and a fractional limit reached the driver as a `datatype mismatch`
// 500. A row count is an integer by nature, so rejecting the fraction is the
// honest answer rather than rounding a caller's request into something they
// did not ask for.
//
// OMITTING these is not the same as passing 0. The SDK applies its own default
// page size (`ADMIN_DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE`, 100) and clamps to
// `ADMIN_MAX_PAGE_SIZE` (500, the `maximum` below), so every response is a
// bounded page — including `?offset=` with no `limit=`, which is a valid
// request that pages through the default-sized window.
//
// `email` is an exact-match FILTER on the fixed list shape (the response is
// still a `users` array, empty when nothing matches), which is how every other
// list here uses query params. It selects a specific principal rather than
// narrowing a scan, so the read resolves the address to an id and reads THAT
// id — it does not page the tenant and keep the row that matches.
//
// FILTER, THEN PAGE, in that order. The window therefore applies to the
// selected row rather than to the scan it would once have been found in: with
// a filter present a response is one row at `offset: 0` and empty beyond it.
// Paging is applied rather than ignored so the endpoint keeps one set of
// semantics, not two — but on a filter that names a single principal it can
// only ever include or exclude that principal.
//
// Carried as a plain string: the trim + lower-case normalization lives at the
// handler seam (`normalizeEmail`), which is also where the single-user path
// parameter is normalized, so both entry points share ONE rule rather than a
// schema transform on one and hand-rolled code on the other.

 * different row shapes. A query flag that changes the response schema can't be
 * expressed as one typed endpoint — the repo's list endpoints use query params
 * only to FILTER a fixed shape (`/tools`, `/connections`), never to switch it.
 * It sorts before `/admin/users/:externalId/...` in the router either way, and
 * "with-connections" is not a valid opaque principal id.
 *
 * ROUTER ORDERING, re-verified now that `/admin/users/:identifier` exists and
 * collides with `/admin/users/with-connections` at the same path depth. The
 * router is find-my-way (`HttpRouter` builds on effect's vendored copy), a
 * radix tree that ranks a STATIC segment above a parametric one at the same
 * position regardless of registration order. Probed directly against the
 * pinned build with the parametric route registered FIRST — the worst case —
 * and `/admin/users/with-connections` still resolves to the list endpoint,
 * while `/admin/users/user_123` and `/admin/users/alice%40example.test` both
 * resolve to the single-user endpoint. The original comment's claim therefore
 * still holds, and the endpoint order below is documentation rather than the
 * thing that makes it work. Registering `:identifier` here and `:externalId`
 * on the nested route is likewise fine: the names differ but they sit at the
