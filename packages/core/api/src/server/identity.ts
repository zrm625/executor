// Provider-neutral identity seam — the ONE auth surface the executor API runs
// on. Cloud (WorkOS api-key + sealed-session) and self-host (Better Auth) each
// supply an `IdentityProvider` Layer; the shared `ExecutionStackMiddleware`
// (see `./execution-stack-middleware.ts`) consumes only this tag, never a
// provider's native session shape. Handlers depend only on `AuthContext`.
//
// Single source of truth promoted out of the two apps:
//   - `Principal`        — the neutral resolved identity (self-host's shape is
//                          the model: org name + roles; cloud passes `roles: []`
//                          and an empty email on the api-key path).
//   - `AuthContext`      — the one Context.Service handlers read (carries roles;
//                          cloud's old tag lacked them, forward-compatible).
//   - `Unauthorized` /   — the shared error set (httpApiStatus 401 / 403 / 503),
//     `NoOrganization` /   shared by every consumer in both apps. Self-host only
//     `Unavailable`        ever produces the first two; cloud also produces
//                          `Unavailable` (503) when api-key validation is down.
//   - `IdentityProvider` — the swap seam: `authenticate(request) =>
//                          Effect<Principal, Unauthorized | NoOrganization |
//                          Unavailable>`.
