// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Shared executor-API ExecutionStackMiddleware.
//
// Cloud and self-host had a structurally identical `HttpRouter` middleware that,
// per request:
//   1. reads the inbound `HttpServerRequest`, converts it to a web `Request`,
//   2. resolves identity (api-key/session for cloud, cookie/bearer/x-api-key for
//      self-host) into a neutral `Principal`,
//   3. builds the per-(user, org) executor + engine via `makeExecutionStack`,
//   4. provides `AuthContext` + the execution-stack services + every plugin
//      extension Service to the wrapped handler.
//
// This factory owns that common body. The differences are injected:
//   - `authenticate`     — the provider's resolve fn. BOTH apps yield the neutral
//                          `Principal` and fail the SHARED `Unauthorized |
//                          NoOrganization | Unavailable` (cloud: WorkOS api-key/
//                          sealed-session; self-host: Better Auth cookie/bearer/
//                          x-api-key). The credential precedence stays INSIDE each
//                          impl.
//   - `renderFailure`    — the failure-rendering strategy. Cloud renders the
//                          shared errors as its exact `{ error, code }` JSON at
//                          401/403/503; self-host catches them into 401/403/503
//                          text. The seam (request -> Principal | shared error) is
//                          identical; only the rendering differs.
//   - `plugins`          — the host's plugin tuple (typed extension Services).
//   - `stackLayer`       — the host's `makeExecutionStack` seam Layer (cloud:
//                          `CloudMeteredExecutionStackLayer`; self-host:
//                          `SelfHostExecutionStackLayer`).
//
// `LongLived` is the boot-scoped context captured at layer-build time (the
// provider tag + the stack's long-lived deps) so the per-request function only
// depends on `HttpRouter`-provided context. The returned value is the
// `HttpRouter.middleware` (NOT `.layer`) so a host can still `.combine(...)` a
// request-scoped middleware into it (cloud folds its per-request DB layer).
