// ExecutorApp.make — the single composition facade every product host calls.
//
// One codebase, three scenarios: cloud / self-host / local are the SAME code
// paths; the difference is a list of injected Layers. `ExecutorApp.make` is the
// shared assembly those Layers slot into — a newcomer reads ONE `make({ … })`
// call and sees the whole scenario (which identity, which DB, which code
// substrate, which MCP, billing present or absent).
//
// It does exactly what each host's hand-rolled composition root did before:
//
//   1. execution stack Layer  = db + engine.codeExecutor + engine.decorator
//                               + plugins.provider + plugins.config            (the makeExecutionStack seams)
//   2. ExecutionStackMiddleware = makeExecutionStackMiddleware(identity-authenticate
//                               + that stack + plugin tuple + failure strategy) (auth + per-request executor)
//   3. the protected (plugin) API = makeProtectedApiLayer(plugins, { errorCapture,
//                               router: prefixed(mountPrefix) }) wrapped by (2)
//   4. the MCP serving envelope = McpServingRoutes + the 2-3 seams (auth/sessions
//                               /reporter), double-provided like the host did      (the seams)
//   5. the account API = makeAccountApiLayer(accountMiddleware, { router })
//   6. each extensions.route (Better Auth handler, Swagger, marketing, /autumn)
//   7. provideMerge(boot) (+ optional requestScoped) -> the AppLayer
//   8. toApiHandler(appLayer) -> { handler, dispose } (web-handler binding)
//
// SEAM vs EXTENSION (the grouping teaches the line):
//   - `providers.*`  = named slots whose Layer satisfies a tag the shared core
//                      RESOLVES (identity, account, db, engine, mcp, plugins,
//                      errorCapture). The app picks the impl; the core names the
//                      tag. `errorCapture` IS a seam — the core resolves it.
//   - `extensions.*` = surface the core never names (routes/services). Better
//                      Auth's /api/auth handler, Swagger, cloud's marketing +
//                      /autumn billing live here. The shared core never imports
//                      them.
//
// `mountPrefix` is a STRING ("/api"); make() builds the `router.prefixed(...)`
// view internally so a host never hand-writes path stripping. `mcpExport` is the
// escape hatch for a platform-only export (cloud's Durable Object class) that the
// runtime needs surfaced but the shared core never names — make() passes it back
// out untouched.
