// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Fixed-executor ExecutionStackMiddleware — the single-scope, boot-built
// execution variant of `./execution-stack-middleware.ts`.
//
// The per-request `ExecutionStackMiddleware` resolves a `Principal` and then
// builds a FRESH per-(user, org) executor each request via `makeExecutionStack`
// -> `makeScopedExecutor`, binding `{ tenant: organizationId, subject:
// accountId }`. That is the cloud / self-host model: a per-request executor
// derived from identity.
//
// Local is structurally different: ONE executor is built once at boot over a
// SINGLE tenant derived from the working directory, with
// `oauthEndpointUrlPolicy: { allowHttp: true }`, and shared across every request
// (and the in-process MCP). There is no per-request (user, org) binding. Forcing
// local through the scoped middleware would (a) swap its cwd tenant for a
// synthetic identity-derived one — orphaning existing `~/.executor` data — and
// (b) silently drop `allowHttp`.
//
// So a host whose execution is a single boot executor supplies a
// `FixedExecutionProvider` (the pre-built executor + engine) and this middleware
// resolves identity to `AuthContext` exactly like the scoped variant, then
// provides the FIXED executor + engine + plugin extension Services to the
// handler — no per-request rebuild. The identity seam still runs (so a host can
// gate or attribute requests), but the executor is constant. This is local's
// genuine model expressed as a first-class `make()` execution mode, not a
// special case bolted onto the scoped path.
