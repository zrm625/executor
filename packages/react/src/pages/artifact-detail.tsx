        That one word is the page's half of fill mode. An artifact on this page

        an unbounded height, and then no amount of `h-full` inside it can resolve
        to anything — which is exactly how a 143-row table used to push its
        "Projects" header, search box and filters off the top of the screen.

        their own padding and simply do not fill.

        quick loading states in three different layouts. So the skeleton mounts
        with the route and stays until the artifact has actually painted, with

    The frame and the skeleton occupy the SAME box, stacked.

    The frame is mounted immediately and at full size — it is not gated on the

    compiles while the skeleton is still up. The skeleton lies over it until the
    artifact paints, and is then removed in one step.

    That ordering is what preserves fill mode: the renderer measures its
    container to decide the frame's height, and that container has the page's
    full content area from the first commit. A skeleton that unmounted to "make
    room" would hand the renderer a container that changed size at the exact
    moment of the swap, which is the layout jump this is meant to avoid. The
    cover is absolutely positioned over that container for the same reason —
    it never participates in the layout the frame is measuring.

    `ClientOnly` and `Suspense` keep their fallbacks, but both are now the same
