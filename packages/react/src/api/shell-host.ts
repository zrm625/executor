/**
 * The HTTP-backed host an embedded MCP-Apps shell talks to.
 *
 * A shell normally runs inside an MCP client, where `callServerTool` is the
 * MCP bridge. On the artifact page there is no MCP client — the console renders
 * the artifact itself — so this adapter answers the same two tool calls over
 * the ordinary executions HTTP API instead:
 *
 *   execute-action        -> POST /executions
 *   execute-action-resume -> POST /executions/:id/resume
 *
 * The shell's `proxy.ts` already turns `tools.a.b.c(...)` into `execute-action`
 * and recurses through `waiting_for_interaction` -> trusted modal -> resume, so
 * elicitation approvals work unchanged; this layer only moves bytes.
 *
 * The type is declared structurally rather than imported from
 * `@executor-js/mcp-apps-shell`: that package depends on THIS one for its
 * component barrel, so a type import here would close a package cycle that
 * turbo rejects outright. The shell's `McpAppsShellHost` is deliberately
 * structural for exactly this reason — see its declaration.
