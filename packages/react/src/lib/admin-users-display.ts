 * so the correct org is known at the call site and is carried in the link
 * rather than left to the recipient's session to guess.
 *
 * The slug is optional because the route's `{-$orgSlug}` segment is: a host that
 * renders no segment yields the bare `/connect/<slug>` form, which is the whole
 * route there. (Both cloud and self-host do canonicalize onto a slug in
 * practice — self-host onto `default` — so the prefixed form is the common
