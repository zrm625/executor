/**
 * The two Vite plugins this package hands to app builds.
 *
 * `innerRendererPlugin` supplies `virtual:executor-inner-renderer`: the shell
 * renders model-written JSX inside a nested `srcDoc` iframe whose whole program
 * is inlined as a string. That string is the inner renderer, bundled to an IIFE
 * by esbuild — it cannot be a normal import, because it must exist as *source
 * text* to be embedded in the sandboxed frame.
 *
 * `mcpAppsShellAsset` supplies `virtual:executor-mcp-apps-shell-html`: the URL
 * of the BUILT, self-contained shell document, emitted into the app's client
 * assets. The console's artifact page loads that URL into a sandboxed iframe
 * and speaks the MCP-Apps protocol to it, exactly as a real MCP-Apps client
 * does with the `ui://executor/shell.html` resource.
 *
 * Both live here rather than in `@executor-js/vite-plugin` because that package
 * is on the plugin-system kill list, and because esbuild, Vite and the shell
 * entry are all this package's own — resolving them from here needs no
 * cross-package path guessing. Apps that embed the shell add both plugins to
 * their vite config; the standalone shell build uses the inner-renderer one
 * too, so there is one definition of how the inner renderer is built.
