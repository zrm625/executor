 *  2. The host's `containerDimensions`, the MCP-Apps way of saying "this is the

 *  3. Otherwise NO cap. An app cannot know how much room its host has; the

 *     `size-changed` and let the host size the frame. Capping here would also be
 *     circular for a host that does exactly that — the shell's own viewport IS
 *     the frame the host is trying to size, so measuring it would pin the frame
 *     to whatever height it already had.
 *
 * The old unconditional 800px default was case 3 done wrong: it silently clipped
 * anything taller, in every host, including ones with room to spare.
 *
 * ## This function is not consulted in fill mode
 *
 * A max height is a ceiling on GROWTH, which is a concept that only means
 * something when the frame grows — that is, inline. In fill mode the shell is
 * already exactly the host's viewport, so there is nothing left to cap: the
 * layout is `height: 100%` all the way down and the artifact scrolls inside
 * itself.
 *
 * That includes `config.maxHeight`. A component asking for a 600px scroll box is
 * describing how it wants to sit inside a taller document; on a page where it IS
 * the document, honoring it would letterbox the artifact into the top 600px of
 * an otherwise empty screen. So in fill mode it is deliberately ignored, and it
 * keeps its exact inline meaning everywhere else.

 *    already resolved (the build did that), plus every utility executor's own
 *    components happen to use. It cannot contain anything else, because
 *    Tailwind only emits utilities it saw in a source file at build time — and
 *    the model's code did not exist then.
 *
 *  - `themeSource` + the in-frame compiler is what makes the model's OWN
 *    classes real. `text-2xl`, `md:grid-cols-4`, `tracking-[0.08em]` — none of
 *    those appear in executor's components, so none of them were in the
 *    compiled sheet, and they silently did nothing: `text-2xl` computed to
 *    16px, a responsive grid stayed one column. The frame therefore gets the
 *    theme as SOURCE, in the `text/tailwindcss` style tag `@tailwindcss/browser`
 *    looks for, and compiles utilities on demand against executor's tokens.
 *
 * The compiler is inlined rather than fetched because the CSP here is
 * `default-src 'none'` with no `connect-src` — deliberately, since artifact code
 * is untrusted. Nothing in this frame may open a connection, so everything it
