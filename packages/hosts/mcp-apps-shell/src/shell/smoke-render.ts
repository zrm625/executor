/**
 * Render an artifact once, in a sandbox, to find out whether it renders at all.
 *
 * The failure this exists for: a model writes `<ChartTooltipContent />` without
 * a `<ChartContainer>`, `create-artifact` accepts it, the row saves, and then
 * the page dies with `useChart must be used within a <ChartContainer />`. The
 * artifact is broken, the user sees an error box, and the model — which got a
 * success back — has no idea. Rendering it once at create time moves that
 * discovery to the only moment it is cheap: the model is still holding the
 * code, and can fix it and retry before anyone sees it.
 *
 * ## Where the code runs, and why that is the whole design
 *
 * The code being rendered was written by a model. It is untrusted, exactly as
 * untrusted as anything `execute` runs — so it runs in the same place: a
 * QuickJS sandbox from the kernel. It never runs in this process.
 *
 * That is not a precaution, it is the only defensible arrangement. An earlier
 * version of this file compiled the artifact and built its component with
 * `new Function` right here, in the trusted server, relying on the ~280-name
 * scope to shadow anything dangerous. Shadowing is not a sandbox: the scope
 * only binds identifiers the code chooses to mention, and `globalThis.process`
 * or `Function("return process")()` walk straight past it to the host's
 * environment — its secrets, its database handle, its network. There is no
 * version of that idea that is safe, so none of it survives here.
 *
 * What crosses the boundary now is a string in and a string out. `code` is
 * embedded as a JSON literal in the expression the sandbox evaluates, and a
 * JSON `SmokeRenderResult` comes back. The renderer itself — React,
 * react-dom/server, the component barrel, the tools proxy, the QueryClient —
 * is prebuilt into `smoke-harness-bundle.gen.ts` and lives entirely inside the
 * sandbox. This process holds no React at all.
 *
 * ## One path, every host
 *
 * QuickJS is a WASM interpreter, so `new Function` inside it is QuickJS
 * building a QuickJS function — not V8 compiling a string. workerd's ban on
 * runtime codegen is a ban on V8 codegen, which is why this same path works on
 * Cloudflare, and why the old "probe `new Function`, skip the check where it
 * throws" carve-out is gone along with the in-process evaluator. Cloud used to
 * silently smoke-render nothing; now it runs the real check like everyone else.
 *
 * ## What it does and does not catch
 *
 * It catches a SYNCHRONOUS FIRST-RENDER THROW: a missing provider, a
 * ReferenceError, a bad hook call, reading a property of something that is
 * undefined before any data has arrived. That last one is not a false positive
 * — `data` genuinely is undefined while a query is pending, so a component that
 * dereferences it without a guard crashes for real, every time, in front of the
 * user. Catching it is the point.
 *
 * It does NOT catch data-shape errors: code that only throws once a tool
 * returns a payload of an unexpected shape. Nothing is fetched here, and
 * inventing a plausible payload would be worse than not trying — it would
 * reject correct code whenever the guess was wrong. That class stays a runtime
 * error inside the frame, where the shell's error boundary already reports it.
 *
 * ## How it stays faithful to the real renderer
 *
 * Everything the component sees comes from the same modules the iframe uses:
 * `compileJsx`/`evaluateComponent` for the scope, `createToolsProxy` for
 * `tools`, and the same `TooltipProvider` + `QueryClientProvider` stack the
 * inner renderer mounts, with the same QueryClient defaults — all of it now
 * compiled into the harness rather than imported here. Anything that drifts is
 * a bug in one shared source rather than a divergence between two.
 *
 * The one deliberate difference is the transport: every tool call returns a
 * promise that never settles, so every query stays `isPending` and the
 * component renders its loading state. That is exactly the state the user sees
 * first in the real frame, and it is the state a first-render crash happens in.
 *
 * ## Boundedness
 *
 * The sandbox's interrupt handler preempts the interpreter, so a synchronous
 * `while (true)` in a component body is now stopped at the deadline. In-process
 * it could not be — no timeout can interrupt a spinning host thread — and such
 * an artifact hung the whole request. Getting that for free is a second reason
 * this belongs in the kernel.
 *
 * ## Fail open
 *
 * A missing harness bundle, an unavailable sandbox, a deadline: all `ok`.
 * "Inconclusive" must never read as "broken", because the cost of a false
 * rejection is a model unable to save correct code. Only a render error from
 * the artifact ITSELF returns `failed`.
