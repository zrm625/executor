/**
 * Connection binding for artifacts — dependency injection instead of a pinned
 * account.
 *
 * A codemode address is five segments:
 * `tools.<integration>.<org|user>.<connection>.<tool>`. That is the right shape
 * for `execute`, where the model is discovering what exists and has to say
 * exactly which row it means. It is the wrong shape for a SAVED artifact: the
 * middle two segments are the author's own connection identity, and freezing
 * them into stored source means the artifact can only ever run as its author.
 * Share it and every `.user.` path resolves against the viewer's subject
 * instead, so the row is invisible and the call fails per-query.
 *
 * So artifact code names an integration ROLE, never a connection:
 *
 *     tools.vercel.domains.getDomains            // the sole vercel role
 *     tools.linear("prod").issues.list           // one of several linear roles
 *     tools.linear("staging").issues.list
 *
 * and the connection arrives at invoke time. `create-artifact` extracts the
 * roles the code actually uses, resolves each to one of the AUTHOR's
 * connections, and persists the result on the artifact row; `execute-action`
 * turns role + stored binding back into the five-segment address immediately
 * before executing. The model-facing address loses two segments and gains
 * portability: rebinding a shared artifact later is a row update, not a rewrite.
 *
 * This is the same model the custom-tools (apps) plugin already uses
 * (`resolveIntegrationBindings` in `@executor-js/plugin-apps`): a tool declares
 * integrations as fields, the caller supplies connections, and the error names
 * the candidates when it can't choose. The vocabulary is deliberately shared —
 * "role", "binding", "choose one of ...".
 *
 * Everything above `resolveArtifactBindings` is pure and string-only, so the
 * grammar can be tested without a store, an executor or a server.
