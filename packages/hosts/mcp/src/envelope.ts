// The provider DECLARES the discovery paths it owns (at least the protected-
// resource metadata document) via `McpAuthProvider.discoveryRoutes`; the
// envelope never hard-codes `/.well-known/oauth-*`. The OAuth endpoints
// (/authorize, /token, /register) stay OUT of the envelope: they are served by
// the provider's own handler (self-host: Better Auth at /api/auth; cloud:
// WorkOS, external). The envelope only needs the provider's discovery routes,
// resource-metadata URL, and authenticate.
//
// The envelope hard-codes ONLY the MCP serving paths and CORS. Everything else
// — every `/.well-known/*` path, the resource-metadata URL, the authn/authz
// semantics, and the entire session lifecycle (create + forward + ownership) —
// comes from the two seams.
//
// Runtime-agnostic: built on `effect/unstable/http` (HttpRouter), NO
// platform-bun. The `/mcp` flow is fully Effect; the streamable-HTTP transport
// works on web `Request`/`Response`, so the envelope reconstructs the inbound
// web request once, hands it to the store, and converts the store's `Response`
// into an Effect response while preserving both streaming bodies and outer
// metadata (the latter matters when the HTTP adapter strips a HEAD body).

 * method with HTTP **400** + `-32000 Server not initialized`. A 400 is a
 * transport-level failure: clients tear the connection down rather than treat
 * it as one request failing. So a client that opens with an optional probe —
 * MCP 2026-07-28 clients lead with `server/discover` — is disconnected before
 * it can fall back to `initialize`, and the handshake never happens.
 *
 * JSON-RPC already has the right answer for a method the dispatcher doesn't
 * know: `-32601 Method not found`, carried on a normal HTTP 200. It is a
 * per-request error, so the connection survives and the client falls back.
 *
 * This deliberately covers ANY method other than `initialize` rather than
 * naming `server/discover`: pre-session, `initialize` is the only method this
 * dispatcher implements, so -32601 is the literal truth for the rest. It also
 * can't silently mask a future real `server/discover` — implementing it means
 * it stops being unknown here, instead of a special case going stale.
 *
 * The guard REPLACES one transport answer and must not shadow any of the
 * others, so it fires only where it is the whole story: a POST that clears the
 * transport's content negotiation AND carries a structurally valid JSON-RPC 2.0
 * request. Everything else succeeds with `null` and reaches the transport
 * untouched, keeping the transport's own response — a non-POST, a bad
 * `Accept`/`Content-Type` (406/415), unparseable JSON or a message that is not
 * a valid JSON-RPC request (400 parse error: a fractional id, a non-object
 * `params`, an unknown top-level field), a batch, a notification or a response
 * (no id to answer), and `initialize` itself.
 *
 * Structural validity is decided by the SDK's own `isJSONRPCRequest`, the exact
 * predicate behind the transport's `JSONRPCMessageSchema.parse`, rather than a
 * hand-rolled re-implementation that could drift from it.
 *
