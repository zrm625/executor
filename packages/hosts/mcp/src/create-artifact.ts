// Code guard
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Generated code is evaluated inside the shell with ~280 names already bound as
// function parameters (React hooks, TanStack Query, every shadcn/Recharts/Lucide
// export, `tools`). A `const Card = ...` in the model's source shadows the real
// binding and the component renders as a blank frame with a confusing runtime
// error — so we reject redeclarations before the code ever reaches the iframe,
// with a message that tells the model what to do instead.
//
// The other rejection is `run(...)`. It was once the escape hatch for multi-step
// composition and is now gone from the scope entirely: arbitrary code is opaque
// to the invalidation helpers (a hand-rolled `queryKey` defeats
// `queryFilter`-based refresh) and to artifact analysis, which reads
// `tools.<integration>...` paths out of the source. Code that calls it would
// fail at render time with a bare ReferenceError, so it is caught here where the
// message can point at the declarative replacement.
//
// The third rejection is a hook called inside a loop body. Models that never
// fetch the skill reach for pagination the imperative way — a `for` loop in the
// component body with a `useQuery` per page, each one `enabled` by the previous
// page's cursor. That is a rules-of-hooks violation (the hook count varies per
// render) and a silently capped read, and `.infiniteQueryOptions` is the thing
// they didn't know about. The error names it.
//
// This is deliberately NOT a general "is this good code" check. The donor branch
// also rejected array literals whose variable name looked data-ish
// (`const rows = [{...},{...}]`), which false-positives on legitimate display
// constants — chart configs, tab definitions, column headers. That heuristic is
// dropped; the "fetch live data with useQuery" guidance lives in the skill.
