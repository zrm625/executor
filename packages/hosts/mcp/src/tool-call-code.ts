/**
 * The `execute-action` wire contract.
 *
 * `execute-action` is the channel a rendered artifact uses to reach an
 * integration, and it used to accept arbitrary code — the same surface as
 * `execute`. That was wider than anything the shell could produce: artifact code
 * is purely declarative `tools.*`, and the shell's proxy serializes every call
 * into exactly one shape.
 *
 * Wider than necessary is also wider than safe. A hostile or confused iframe
 * could post arbitrary source down the app channel even though no affordance in
 * the shell ever writes any. So the server parses `execute-action` against the
 * one grammar the proxy emits:
 *
 *     return await tools.<ident>("<role>")?(.<ident>)*(<JSON>)
 *
 * One awaited tool call, one JSON-literal argument, nothing else — no
 * statements, no loops, no composition. `execute` (the model-facing codemode
 * tool) is untouched; this constraint is only for the app-originated channel.
 *
 * The leading identifier is an INTEGRATION, not a connection: artifact paths
 * carry no tier and no connection name (see `artifact-bindings.ts`). The
 * optional string call right after it is the integration ROLE, which is how an
 * artifact using two accounts of one integration says which it means. Both are
 * resolved to a full address server-side, against the bindings stored on the
 * artifact row — so what arrives here is never an address the iframe chose.
 *
 * The producing half is `toolCallCode` in
 * `@executor-js/mcp-apps-shell/shell/proxy`, and `tool-call-grammar.pin.test.ts`
 * in that package pins the two together so neither can drift.
